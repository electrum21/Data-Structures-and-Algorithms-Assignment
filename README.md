This assignment was done as part of Nanyang Polytechnic's Data Structure and Algorithms module.

The purpose of the Medicine Inventory System is to allow a pharmaceutical company to manage the Medicine Inventory in the Pharmacy. They can display, add, update and remove medicine record from the inventory, perform searching and sorting of records, and other additional features that improve the usefulness of the application for the user.

<b>Medicine Inventory – Basic Features</b>

a. Design a suitable data structure (e.g. by making use of Python list, dictionary, objects, etc.) to manage the medicine records. You are required to store the following medicine records with information such as: record index, MedicineName, SupplierName, Purpose of the Medicine and at least TWO OTHER information of your choice. Each record will have the above attributes. The medicine inventory will store up to 20 records.

b. Design a menu for the application to allow the user to perform the following:
 Add record
 Update selected record
 Remove record
 Display all records
 Sort record
 Search record
 Exit Application

c. Complete the (Add, Update, Remove and Display) operations


<b>Medicine Inventory – Search and Sort Algorithms</b> 

d. Complete the Sort records option. Student must implement 3 sorting algorithms. They are Bubble, Selection and Insertion Sort algorithms to sort records based on a search key e.g. MedicineName, Supplier, etc. Student can decide on which search key to apply.

e. Complete the Search record option. Student will apply 2 search algorithms. They are Linear and Binary Search algorithm to search for record based on a search key. Student will decide which search key but must implement both search algorithms.

f. Student may add in bonus features such as exception handling, advanced algorithms etc.
